I will just explain a little bit of what I did; I am an avid F1 fan, and wanted to do somrthing related to it. Hence, I decided to create an interactive globe such that any country you click on, it will list the name's of the people who have raced as Formula 1 drivers from that specific country. But, I then encountered a challenge; there was no API/database for the exact data I was looking for; hence levereging my python skills, I then made a web-scraper that scraped all the data I wanted (the python file is there in this repo too) and created a json file, which I fetched in my React app!
